    "> Stephen C. Johnson, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, came up with lint in 1978 while debugging the Yacc grammar he was writing for C and dealing with portability issues stemming from porting Unix to a 32-bit machine. The term \"lint\" was derived from the name of the undesirable bits of fiber and fluff found in sheep's wool. In 1979, lint was used outside of Bell Labs for the first time in the seventh version  of the Unix operating system. - [wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))"
