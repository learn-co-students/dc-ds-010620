    "The mayor's office has hired Flatiron Data Science Immersive students to determine a way to fix traffic congestion. A good starting point is to determine out what proportion of the population of DC owns a car.\n",

    "A data scientist wants to examine if there is an effect on IQ scores when using tutors. To analyze this, she conducts IQ tests on a sample of 40 students, and wants to compare her students' IQ to the general population IQ. The way an IQ score is structured, we know that a standardized IQ test has a mean of 100, and a standard deviation of 16. When she tests her group of students, however, she gets an average IQ of 103. Based on this finding, does tutoring make a difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: State Your Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis always reflects the idea or theory that needs to be tested. For this problem, you want to test if the tutoring has resulted in a significant increase in student IQ. So, you would write it down as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sample mean is **significantly** bigger than the population mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, significance is key here. If we denote sample mean as $\\bar{x}$, and population mean as mu ($\\mu$), you can write the alternative hypothesis as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large H_a\\text{:   }\\mu < \\bar{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis here is that $\\mu$ is less than $M$. In other situations, you could check for both possibilities of $\\mu$ being smaller OR bigger than by checking  $\\mu \\neq M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe the tutoring results as a lower IQ... Who knows!\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, you'll just check for the **significant increase**, for now, to keep the process simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a one-sample z-test, you define your null hypothesis as there being **no significant difference** between specified sample and population. This means that under the null hypothesis, you assume that any observed (generally small) difference may be present due to sampling or experimental error. Considering this, for this problem, you can define a null hypothesis ($H_0$) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is **no significant difference** between the sample mean and population mean \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the emphasis is on a _significant_ difference, rather than just any difference as a natural result of taking samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denoting the sample mean as $M$, and the population mean as mu ($\\mu$), you can write the null hypothesis as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large H_0\\text{:   }\\mu \\geq \\bar{x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Specify a Significance Level (alpha)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your hypotheses are in place, you have to decide on your significance level alpha ($\\alpha$) as a cut-off value to define whether you can reject your null hypothesis or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed previously, often, $\\alpha$ is set to 0.05, which also has as a side-effect that there is a 5 percent chance that you will reject the null hypothesis when it is true.\n",
    "Later, you'll see that using alpha, you'll formulate your test result as: \"with a confidence level of 95%, we can state that...\". For a z-distribution, this can be shown as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/hypothesis_test.png\" width=670>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you test both sides of the distribution ($\\mu \\neq \\bar{x}$, when $\\mu$ can either be smaller OR bigger), you need to perform a 2-tail test to see if tutoring lowers OR highers the IQ of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each red region would be calculated as $\\dfrac{\\alpha}{2}$. When testing of a single side (as in the example) i.e. just higher OR just lower, you can use a one-tail test as shown in the first and second images. The $\\alpha$ value we use is 0.05 or $5\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Calculate the test statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "For z-tests, a z-statistic is used as our test statistic. You'll see other statistics suitable for other tests later. A one-sample z-statistic is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\large \\text{z-statistic} = \\dfrac{\\bar x - \\mu_0}{{\\sigma}/{\\sqrt{n}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula slightly differs from the standard score formula. It includes the square square root of n to reflect that we are dealing with the sample variance here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, all you need to do is use this formula given your sample mean $\\bar x$, the population standard deviation $\\sigma$, and the number of items in the sample ($n$). $\\mu_0$ is the mean you're testing the hypothesis for, or the \"hypothesized mean\". \n",
    "\n",
